Our methodology is a car safety technology to help save the life of the driver and the passengers  by preventing accidents if and when the driver is distracted while driving. The main objective is to first design a system to perceive the driverâ€™s mannerisms and concentration by continuously monitoring retina of the eye, his face movements etc. The system works in spite of the driver wearing spectacles and in various lighting conditions. The main objective is to bring the driver back from any kind of distraction by using buzzer or alarm. This can also help in reducing over-speeding and rash driving. Traffic management can be maintained by using our software for greater benefit to everyone.
